# A Beginner-Friendly LaTeX Thesis Template for Computer Science Students at Dalhousie University

## Introduction  

LaTeX is a powerful tool for writing academic documents, but its complex syntax can be intimidating for beginners. To make the process easier, I customized the Dalhousie University Thesis Template to include the common syntax and components necessary for thesis writing, aiming to give students a quick, no-obstacle to mastering LaTeX document generation.
